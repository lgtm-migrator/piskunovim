### Introduction

We live in a time when many devices pass through our hands. There are two main reasons for this: technological progress and the constant search for a device that would satisfy your needs.

One day, the Logitech MX case keyboard fell into my hands and since then it has become the main keyboard in my house. Today, I am the happy owner of three keyboards of the MX Keys series:

- Logitech MX Keys Mini,
- Logitech MX Keys,
- Logitech Craft.

And today I would like to share which one is my favorite and why.

### Advantages

Among the main advantages of all three keyboards for me, I highlight:

1. Quiet key travel.
2. Ability to connect to three different devices.
3. Wireless connection.
4. Long life battery.

Logitech MX Keys is the balanced full scale keyboard in the series. Looks and feels like a great keyboard. Weight is average. Connection technology: Logitech Unifying (I'll tell you a little later, this is important).

Logitech Craft is a copy of the Logitech MX Keys, weighted down in my opinion an absolutely useless feature called "crown" (such an input dial that you will not use even in those cases where it's implied). The weight is heavy. Connectivity technology: Logitech Unifying.

Logitech MX Keys Mini is a minimized version of the main brother MX Keys. The numpad has been removed, the main letter keys haven't been touched, and the bottom row of the keyboard has been more tightly packed. The weight is light. Connectivity technology: Bluetooth.

### About connectivity technologies

Let's talk about two fact that apply to all the keyboards we're talking today:

1. You cannot use any of these keyboards as a wired one.

2. You can connect all these keyboards via Bluetooth.

The second item in the list means a lot of devices that you're free to be connected easily. And the first one...well...means that we have an issue on BIOS[POST] step, when the Bluetooth driver isn't loaded yet.

Some motherboards support Bluetooth loading in POST, but it will cost you extra money. Logitech MX Keys and Logitech Craft have a resolution of this issue called Logitech's Unifying technology. All you need to do is to plug in the usb dongle from the kit inside your computer and the keyboards will be available in BIOS.

MX Keys Mini has no workaround. It's truly Bluetooth keyboard and that's it. That means, in order to use the keyboard in BIOS, you just need another keyboard.

Logitech Unifying technology also saves battery life, so the keyboard will work longer without charge.

All keyboards on a single charge last approximately 14 days. You are more likely to forget when you last charged it, and you will want to connect it yourself, than it will be discharged. The time frame is impressive.

### Summary

In terms of form factor, I'd personally choose the MX Keys Mini. It's a great keyboard for traveling, it has all main features of the MX Keys series, it's ultimately comfortable to use and it has takes up little space at home. But! Doesn't work in BIOS.

The most balanced option is MX Keys. Yes, I'm repeating it, but that's true. It's full scaled, it's still lightweight, and it works in BIOS.

And, I'm sorry, but Logitech Craft is rubbish. Frankly, it's not so different from the MX Keys, but you have to pay extra money for the noticeable weight and the "crown" spinner. And that's not fair.

And the winner is: MX Keys Mini. Just because in my case, the form factor makes more sense than BIOS usage. Just look again how does it look like on table.

PS: Some people say that MX Key keyboards has a proverbial slant. That's true, but in fact, you won't notice it. I didn't until someone told me about that.
