My name is Igor. I’m a full stack developer with middle knowledge in front-end, back-end, and mobile development. I’ve started learning to code with C++, then learned Java SE basics and developed my first Android 4.4 application on the base of self-service terminals software (I worked with this kind of systems for 3 years).

Then I’ve learned JavaScript and used NodeJS as a server for an Android chat application. And that was my first big experience with server-side JS, WebSockets and SMS gateway. Since last year I've become a developer in Canada e-commerce project.

Stack doesn't make a developer, but developer creates its own stack. Let's figure out something new every day. Let's keep in touch.
